    <h2>Assignment 1 Reflection</h2>

        I encountered some difficulties in learning how to use GitHub while completing this assignment. 
      However, I’ve managed to solve them by searching online and adapting based on my past experiences. 
      From this assignment, I learned how to build the basic structure of a web page. 
      I already had a general idea of what HTML looked like, but I hadn’t learned how to actually create one before.
      I relied heavily on the course handouts and example code to complete this assignment, 
      since they were very detailed and already well-structured, making them great learning references.
