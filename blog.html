    <h2>Assignment 1 Reflection</h2>
    <p>Date: October 13, 2025</p>

    <p>
        I encountered some difficulties in learning how to use GitHub while completing this assignment. 
      However, I’ve managed to solve them by searching online and adapting based on my past experiences. 
      From this assignment, I learned how to build the basic structure of a web page. 
      I already had a general idea of what HTML looked like, but I hadn’t learned how to actually create one before.
      I relied heavily on the course handouts and example code to complete this assignment, 
      since they were very detailed and already well-structured, making them great learning references.

    <h2>Assignment 2 Reflection</h2>

      The main difficulties I encountered in this assignment were managing the post images to make them look neat 
      and implementing various hover effects, such as the “Add Post” button. 
      I solved the first problem by checking examples from the course lecture notes—it turned out that I had simply 
      forgotten to include a few lines of code. For the second issue, I referred to examples from several tutorial 
      websites mentioned on the course site. Additionally, I experienced some power supply issues, which made it 
      difficult for me to complete the assignment on time. I found the CSS resources provided on the course website 
      very helpful—I mainly relied on them to finish this assignment, as they were both detailed and easy to understand.

      <h2>Assignment 3 Reflection</h2>
      <p>Date: Nov.12, 2025</p>

        This assignment was a bit tricky, especially figuring out how to make the page update and show only the correct posts based on filters.
        I mainly used the week 5–6 lecture notes, example code, and a few online resources.
        I also Google some info about how to achieve this. Through this work, I learned how to make a webpage interactive and respond to user actions.
