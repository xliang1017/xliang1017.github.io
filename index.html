        <p>My name is Xiyuan Liang</p>
        <p>Email: liangxiy@oregonstate.edu</p>
        <p>CS major, 2022</p>
        <p>I don’t have much experience — I’ve only tried using Chrome’s “View Page Source” feature to replace certain design elements, such as images, to experiment with one-time webpage customization or to extract images and videos from web pages.</p>
        <p>I hope to learn how to create my own website and build its features through this course.
        <p>Yes, I did check the Ed posts</p>
        <p>My most interesting experience was meeting many online friends who share similar interests by chance, and later participating in exhibitions organized by a few of them (remotely, since I still had to attend school). I made and exchanged fan-made merchandise, such as badges and keychains, with other participants, and received many handmade items from others in return — all without having to buy anything.</p>
